    Good morning,dear professors. It's my honor to be here. My name is Yinjimin,from Hengyang,Hunan province. I graduated
from Hunan University of Technology majoring in Computer Science and Technology in Twenty-eighteen. And have been working
as a software developer until last May. I'm quite sure that it's a promising profession, and I'm deeply interested in it,
so I have decided to dedicate the rest of my life to it.
    I have lots of habbies, especially loves to study. In my spare time, I often spend time working on new technologies.
As for my personality, my friends often call me a hard-working person with teamwork spirit. Therefore, I'm confident that
I can get used to the new life within no time and survive the postgraduate years if I'm blessed with the chance.
    Again, I'd like to express my gratitude for such a precious opportunity, I'm looking forward to your priceless guidance
in the coming years and I'll spare no effort to make the best of it.
    That's all for my introduction, thank you
