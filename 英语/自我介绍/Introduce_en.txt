    Good morning/afternoon, dear professors.  It's my honor to be here. My name is Yinjimin, from Hengyang, Hunan province.
    I graduated from Hunan University of Technology majoring in Computer Science and Technology in twenty-eighteen, and have been working as a software developer until last May.
    In this way, I have acquired working experience in this field.
    I am quite sure that it is a promising profession, and I'm deeply interested in it.
    So I have decided to dedicate the rest of my list to it.

    I have lots of habbied, during my working time, I often enjoy spending time working on new technologies. As for my personality, my friends often call me an hard-working person with teamwork spirit.

    Therefore, I'm confident that I can get used to the new life here within no time and survive the postgraduate years-if I'm blessed with the chance.

    Again, I'd like to express my gratitude for such a precious opportunity.
    I'm looking forward to your priceless guidance in the coming years and I'll spare no effort tot make the best of it.

    That's all for my introduction, thank you!
